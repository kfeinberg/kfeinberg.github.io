            This project is the first one on this website that was not created by only me. I worked on this project with a classmate of mine in our “Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming” class.
            It has simple functionality, but works similar to Dropbox. It is currently not password protected, but a user must enter a username to login to their dashboard and see their files. As a creative portion, we implemented the ability for a user to register themselves and also share their files with other users that have accounts on the website.
            We mainly used PHP to create the site. It is hosted on an EC2 Instance hosted through AWS.
