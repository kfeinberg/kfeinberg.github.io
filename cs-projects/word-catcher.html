            This is a project I created alongside my students in the Girl Who Code Summer Immersion Program. My students had the idea for a Chrome Extension dictionary with the ability to save words
            so that users could refer back to their saved words later. This was the first time I have had to 
            teach myself a technology I had not learned before in school. Although we ended up not publishing the project,
            we had a great time working on it, and all learned a lot about web development. <a href = "https://github.com/kfeinberg/word-catcher">Link to repository.</a>
